## Viewer Instructions
* The viewer needs a marker, which is by default the [Hiro marker](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_rXmUhrNCt8/W0YImGVS1UI/AAAAAAAAECk/5uR-aSWdyx08jxRpRili6_B8D7NiCNHiQCLcBGAs/s320/hiro.png)

* Pull it up on your phone or print it out, and then show it to the camera. Your model should load slightly underneath it. 
* You can create your own marker [here](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html). 
* Or use NFT (natural feature tracking) by AR.js when it becomes more reliable with time.

## Setup
[Add 3D models](https://docs.echo3D.co/quickstart/add-a-3d-model) to the console.

## Run
* Run locally or using a web server.
* Input your API key.

## Real-time Updates
Add/remove/edit models in the console and notice that the interactive models in the site change on reload.
